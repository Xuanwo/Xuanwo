## Welcome / Introductions

Speaker: Xuanwo

Brief introductory remarks, thank to the sponsor, outline of the day, participant introductions (name, github handle, optional affiliation,  optional reason you came to the meetup)

## Talks

Call for Presenters: 10-15 minute low key introduction to your project/product, how you use Iceberg, and any thoughts you may have about what, found challenging, and any things you are working on / thinking about.

TBD

## Breakouts / Discussions

The idea is that we will break into small groups for 3 x 20 minute sessions. I will ring a gong or something similar every 20 minutes and you should find a new group to discuss.

Potential seed topics (but obviously feel free to discuss anything):

- How do we make it easier for people to build systems on Iceberg? What are the current barriers to community growth as you see them?
- How do we make it easier for people to contribute back to Iceberg? What are the current barriers to contribution
- What features would you like to see / not see

Ideally, in each session, one or more people would volunteer to write up any insights they got from the discussions, and post them to the overall ticket.
