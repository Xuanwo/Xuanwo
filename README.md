I'm trying to **work** and **think** in an open-source way.

## Work publicly and report to the community

- I get paid for my work in open source projects. (For now, I'm backed by [@datafuselabs](https://github.com/datafuselabs))
- I publicly track all my works at [Xuanwo's Work](https://work.xuanwo.io)

Projects that I'm working on

- [databend](https://github.com/datafuselabs/databend): A modern Elasticity and Performance cloud data warehouse, activate your object storage for real-time analytics.
- [opendal](https://github.com/datafuselabs/opendal): Open Data Access Layer that connect the whole world together.
- [reqsign](https://github.com/Xuanwo/reqsign): Signing HTTP requests without heavy SDKs.

- [serde-bridge](https://github.com/Xuanwo/serde-bridge): A bridge between different serde implemantations.
- [serde-env](https://github.com/Xuanwo/serde-env): Deserialize env into structs via serde.
- [serfig](https://github.com/Xuanwo/serfig): Layered configuration system built upon serde.

- [globiter](https://github.com/Xuanwo/globiter): Turns glob range and set into Iterator.

## Think publicly and export to blog posts

- I will write at [Xuanwo's Blog](https://xuanwo.io) if there are any thought I think is meaningful to report.
- I will update my newsletter at [Xuanwo's Newsletter](https://newsletter.xuanwo.io/).
  
**Let's rock!**
